# Portfolio Page

## Objective

Build a CodePen.io app for a personal portfolio page that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNBOYG

## User Stories

* User Story #1: My portfolio should have a welcome section with an id of welcome-section.
* User Story #2: The welcome section should have an h1 element that contains text.
* User Story #3: My portfolio should have a projects section with an id of projects.
* User Story #4: The projects section should contain at least one element with a class of project-tile to hold a project.
* User Story #5: The projects section should contain at least one link to a project.
* User Story #6: My portfolio should have a navbar with an id of navbar.
* User Story #7: The navbar should contain at least one link that I can click on to navigate to different sections of the page.
* User Story #8: My portfolio should have a link with an id of profile-link, which opens my GitHub or FCC profile in a new tab.
* User Story #9: My portfolio should have at least one media query.
* User Story #10: The height of the welcome section should be equal to the height of the viewport.
* User Story #11: The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.


## Plan of action

Run all user story tests by forking [this CodePen pen](http://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/pen/MJjpwO). The code is expected to fulfill the above user stories and get all of the tests to pass.

I chose to make a personal homepage for myself. Live version here that passes all tests: https://codepen.io/pdwarkanath/full/LqWOQd 

The live webpage is hosted here: http://people.tamu.edu/~pdwarkanath/
