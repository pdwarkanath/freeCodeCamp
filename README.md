# freeCodeCamp

My solutions to freeCodeCamp challenges and projects https://www.freecodecamp.org/

Challenges are basic steps in learning. They can be completed by changing one line of code. Projects involve a lot more work and combine concepts learned from multiple challenges. I will add the files I develop for these as I progress through the curriculum.


## Projects

The individual project folders have readme files that describe the projects in more detail
